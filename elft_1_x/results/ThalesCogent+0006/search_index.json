The sample is used to assess whether an implementation adheres to the computational speed requirements from the ELFT Test Plan. These values are chosen in such a way that allows the implementation flexibility while allowing NIST to complete the evaluation in a reasonable amount of time. If an implementation exceeds the maximum allowable duration, the participant will be asked to reduce the processing time of their software prior to NIST completing the evaluation. As such, all published ELFT submissions conform to the published speed requirements. 2.1 Processor Details All measurements in this section were performed on a machine equipped with Intel Xeon Gold 6254 Central Processing Units (CPUs). Each CPU features a 3.10 GHz base frequency and 24.75 MB of cache. Timing tests are all single threaded—implementations are not permitted to use more than one thread during any function measured here. As such, these values can be used to understand expected scaled performance. NIST testing code embraces the single-threaded nature of implementations to fork processes during other non-timed portions of this evaluation, allowing participants to write thread-unsafe code while still using NIST resources to their maximum efficiency. This CPU supports executing several families of processor intrinsic functions, including AVX-5121. 2.2 Composition Table 2.1 shows the quantity of each type of fingerprint image comprising the timing sample dataset.

Failures of any kind reported during template generation result in NIST code writing 0 byte files. These files are excluded from the template size analysis in this section.

Figure 2.3: Amount of RAM used while creating templates in the Timing Sample dataset. 2.4 Enrollment Database Reference templates are combined into a participant-defined database structure for optimal searching. The required storage for the Timing Sample enrollment database with plain impression distractors was 183.4 GB, and the required storage for the Timing Sample enrollment database with rolled impression distractors was 278.8 GB. Each database consisted of the same ≈ 1 600 000 non-mated subjects. Each subject had at least one, but typically ten, distal phalanx captures to enroll. ≈ 150 000 had one or more palm captures. 2.5 Search Out of the latent templates generated in Table 2.1, a fixed random sample of 100 of the resulting latent templates were searched against the enrollment databases described in Subsection 2.4. The results presented in Subsection 2.5 are based on the measurements made on or during those 100 searches. 2.5.1 Search Duration Table 2.4 and Figure 2.4 show the amount of time elapsed during searches of the fixed search probe set when searching against the enrollment databases described in Subsection 2.4. While unsuccessful searches expend operator time, they are not included in this metric, because search failures typically occur instantaneously (e.g., a template indicates that a probe was of too poor quality to search), which can artificially lower the average search time. ELFT defines maximum average search durations for participants based on the number of subjects in the enrollment database. Due to the potential for extended runtimes, NIST may choose to allow some discretion in the enforcement of maximum search durations during times of high demand for compute resources. For example, if a maximum average search duration was 4 hours, but after completing all searches, the average search duration was 4.5 hours, it may be prudent to continue the evaluation, since a resubmission may require regeneration of millions of templates and several thousand repeated searches.

Implementations were permitted to use up to 300 GB to store templates. Note the different scales on each panel—implementations that do not change the contents of RAM may not show variation.

Region: The correct region of the correct subject was returned. For search probes sourced from a distal phalanx (i.e., a “latent fingerprint”), the correct finger position 1–10 shall be returned. For search probes sourced from a palm or a non-distal phalanx, the most localized region shall be returned. Some palm regions may be interchangeable based on the exemplars provided (e.g., a palm probe’s source could reasonably be seen in a lower palm, hypothenar, and writer’s palm exemplar). Credit is given for Region in this case. Hand: A friction ridge position from anywhere on the correct hand of the correct subject is returned. This is designed to aid in diagnosing segmentation error. Subject: Any finger position from the correct subject is returned. This is designed to reward the situation where an implementation cannot ascertain the most localized region from the set of exemplars enrolled. 3.2 Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) The Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) plots in this document show the false negative identification rate (FNIR) without respect for similarity score when searching probes against a enrollment database where a single mated identity for each search probe was present. ≈ 1 600 000 non-mated subjects were enrolled. All subjects had at least one, but typically ten, distal phalanx captures to enroll. ≈ 150 000 had one or more palm captures to enroll. Two different combinations of non-mates were searched in separate enrollment databases. While both contain the identical subjects, one set contains only plain impressions and the other contains only rolled impressions. The requested size of the candidate list was always 100 subjects. All possible Extended Feature Set (EFS) data was provided when “Image + EFS” is listed for probes. The type of EFS data present varies for each sample in each dataset. Initial experiments show nominal (if any) change when EFS data was provided alongside exemplars. Probe impression type was always “Unknown Finger” or “Unknown Palm,” as appropriate. Future studies may show results using the impression type “Unknown Friction Ridge” for both types of probes. The metric hit rate is equivalent to 1 − miss rate, or 1 − FNIR. For example, an FNIR of 0.1 indicates a hit rate of 0.9 (i.e., 90%). 3.3 Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) The Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) plots in this document show the tradeoff between false positive and false negative identification rates when searching probes against a enrollment database where a single mated identity for each search probe was present. ≈ 1 600 000 non-mated subjects were enrolled. All subjects had at least one, but typically ten, distal phalanx captures to enroll. ≈ 150 000 had one or more palm captures to enroll. Two different combinations of non-mates were searched in separate enrollment databases. While both contain the identical subjects, one set contains only plain impressions and the other contains only rolled impressions. Non-mated similarity scores come from all ranks when searching probes against an enrollment dataset without any mated subjects enrolled. The requested size of the candidate list was always 100 subjects. Mated similarity scores come from the correct location appearing at any rank. All possible EFS data was provided when “Image + EFS” is listed for probes. The type of EFS data present varies for each sample in each dataset. Initial experiments show nominal (if any) change when EFS data was provided alongside exemplars. Probe impression type was always “Unknown Finger” or “Unknown Palm,” as appropriate. Future studies may show results using the impression type “Unknown Friction Ridge” for both types of probes.
