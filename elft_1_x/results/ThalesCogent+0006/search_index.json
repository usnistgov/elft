The sample is used to assess whether an implementation adheres to the computational speed requirements from the ELFT Test Plan. These values are chosen in such a way that allows the implementation flexibility while allowing NIST to complete the evaluation in a reasonable amount of time. If an implementation exceeds the maximum allowable duration, the participant will be asked to reduce the processing time of their software prior to NIST completing the evaluation. As such, all published ELFT submissions conform to the published speed requirements. 2.1 Processor Details All measurements in this section were performed on a machine equipped with Intel Xeon Gold 6254 Central Processing Units (CPUs). Each CPU features a 3.10 GHz base frequency and 24.75 MB of cache. Timing tests are all single threaded—implementations are not permitted to use more than one CPU core during any function measured here. As such, these values can be used to understand expected scaled performance. NIST testing code embraces the single-threaded nature of implementations to fork processes during other non-timed portions of this evaluation, allowing participants to write thread-unsafe code while still using NIST resources to their maximum efficiency. This CPU supports executing several families of processor intrinsic functions, including AVX-5121. 2.2 Composition Table 2.1 shows the quantity of each type of fingerprint image comprising the timing sample dataset.

Figure 2.3: Amount of RAM used while creating templates in the Timing Sample dataset. 2.4 Enrollment Database Reference templates are combined into a participant-defined database structure for optimal searching. Each database consisted of ≈ 1 600 000 distractor subjects. Each subject had at least one, but typically twenty, distal phalanges distributed over rolled and flat impression captures to enroll. ≈ 150 000 had one or more palm captures. While the participant-defined enrollment database should contain information about all references, the file size may be significantly different than the space consumed by concatenation of all individual reference templates. Additionally, the participant-defined database structure may be a structure unique or especially optimized for this evaluation and not necessarily similar to a structure deployed operationally. The sum of file sizes for both types of reference storage are shown in Table 2.4. Table 2.4: Sum of file storage needed to hold all distractor reference templates in the Timing Sample. Storage Type Size Participant-Defined Enrollment Database 439.8 GB Raw Templates on Disk 252.4 GB 2.5 Search Out of the latent templates generated in Table 2.1, a fixed random sample of 24 of the resulting latent templates were searched against the enrollment database described in Subsection 2.4. The results presented in Subsection 2.5 are based on the measurements made on or during those 24 searches. 2.5.1 Search Duration Table 2.5 and Figure 2.4 show the amount of time elapsed during searches of the fixed search probe set when searching against the enrollment database described in Subsection 2.4. While unsuccessful searches expend operator time, they are not included in this metric, because search failures typically occur instantaneously (e.g., a template indicates that a probe was of too poor quality to search), which can artificially lower the average search time. ELFT defines maximum average search durations for participants based on the number of subjects in the enrollment database. Due to the potential for extended runtimes, NIST may choose to allow some discretion in the enforcement of maximum search durations during times of high demand for compute resources. For example, if a maximum average search duration was 4 hours, but after completing all searches, the average search duration was 4.5 hours, it may be prudent to continue the evaluation, since a resubmission may require regeneration of millions of templates and several thousand repeated searches. Note: In March 2023, NIST lowered the number of searches from 100 to 25, with all 25 probes depicting a distal phalanx. It also doubled the average quantity of impressions per subject by combining previously separate plain and rolled impressions for each subject. ELFT does not mandate the strategy in which multiple impressions of the same reference finger are stored or searched in the enrollment database, but it does impose search time maximums on a per-subject basis, not per-impression. This means that in Table 2.5 and Figure 2.4, there may be average search durations significantly higher than the evaluation permitted maximum for implementations submitted prior to March 2023. Note: In October 2023, NIST discovered a probe image in the search dataset contained invalid resolution information. This probe has been removed from the test, reducing the number of searches to 24. Evaluations run prior to this change will show total elapsed time measures including the now-omitted search.

Vertical lines from left to right indicate the 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles respectively. 2.5.2 Search Memory Consumption Figure 2.5 shows the amount of RAM consumed by the single testing process as a function of time during the search procedure, including RAM consumed by the NIST testing apparatus. Implementations were permitted to use up to 300 GB of RAM (of a total available 384 GB) to load their enrollment database, the rest of which was stored on a local solid-state storage device. Note the different scales on each panel—implementations that do not change the contents of RAM may not show variation.

Region: The correct region of the correct subject was returned. For search probes sourced from a distal phalanx (i.e., a “latent fingerprint”), the correct finger position 1–10 shall be returned. For search probes sourced from a palm or a non-distal phalanx, the most localized region shall be returned. Some palm regions may be interchangeable based on the exemplars provided (e.g., a palm probe’s source could reasonably be seen in a lower palm, hypothenar, and writer’s palm exemplar). Credit is given for Region in this case. Subject: Any position from the correct subject is returned. This is designed to reward the situation where an implementation cannot ascertain the most localized region from the set of exemplars enrolled and may indicate segmentation error. 3.2 Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) The Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) plots in this document show the false negative identification rate (FNIR) without respect for similarity score when searching probes against a enrollment database where a single mated identity for each search probe was present. ≈ 1 600 000 non-mated subjects were enrolled. All subjects had at least one, but typically twenty, images containing distal phalanges. This typically included ten individually rolled impressions and “Identification Flat” captures featuring more than one distal phalanx per image that must be segmented by the implementation. ≈ 150 000 had one or more palm captures to enroll. The requested size of the candidate list was always 100 subjects. All possible Extended Feature Set (EFS) data was provided when “Image + EFS” is listed for probes. The type and quantity of EFS data present varies for each sample in each dataset and may have been entirely omitted. Initial experiments show nominal (if any) change when EFS data was provided alongside exemplars. Probe impression type was always “Unknown Finger” or “Unknown Palm,” as appropriate. Future studies may show results using the impression type “Unknown Friction Ridge” for both types of probes. The metric hit rate is equivalent to 1 − miss rate, or 1 − FNIR. For example, an FNIR of 0.1 indicates a hit rate of 0.9 (i.e., 90%). 3.3 Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) The Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) plots in this document show the tradeoff between false positive and false negative identification rates when searching probes against a enrollment database where a single mated identity for each search probe was present. ≈ 1 600 000 non-mated subjects were enrolled. All subjects had at least one, but typically twenty, images containing distal phalanges. This typically included ten individually rolled impressions and “Identification Flat” captures featuring more than one distal phalanx per image that must be segmented by the implementation. ≈ 150 000 had one or more palm captures to enroll. Non-mated similarity scores come from rank = 1 when searching probes against an enrollment dataset without any mated subjects enrolled. The requested size of the candidate list was always 100 subjects. Mated similarity scores come from the correct location appearing at any rank. All possible EFS data was provided when “Image + EFS” is listed for probes. The type and quantity of EFS data present varies for each sample in each dataset and may have been entirely omitted. Initial experiments show nominal (if any) change when EFS data was provided alongside exemplars. Probe impression type was always “Unknown Finger” or “Unknown Palm,” as appropriate. Future studies may show results using the impression type “Unknown Friction Ridge” for both types of probes.

This dataset consist of of 2 174 operational latent probes. No EFS data was provided for probes or mated exemplars. All probes searched were a single friction ridge sample from somewhere on the hand. Because the ELFT API indicates to implementations whether an image comes from the distal or palm region, analysis is separated between the two. Note: While NIST biometric technology evaluations typically use sequestered law enforcement data, a literature search indicates that this collection of data may have been supplied to other research organizations that are not subject to the same strict sequestration policies as NIST. 7.1 Failures Table 7.1 shows the number of failures to create templates.
