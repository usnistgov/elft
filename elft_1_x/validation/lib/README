Place your libraries in this directory.

We strongly encourage setting the RUNPATH (not RPATH) of your core library to
$ORIGIN to find dependent libraries. Regardless, do NOT hardcode paths to either
this directory ('lib') or 'config' to load dependencies. These paths, even if
relative, will NOT exist. Remember, the only library explicitly linked to NIST's
testing code will be the core library.
