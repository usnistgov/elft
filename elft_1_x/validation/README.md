ELFT Validation
===============

We require exercising ELFT [API] implementations with the ELFT validation
package. Validation is mutually-beneficial to NIST and ELFT participants. The
hope is that successful execution of validation ensures your algorithm:

 * runs as expected at NIST;
 * does not crash;
 * syntactically and semantically implements the [API] correctly.

This helps cut the runtime of the evaluation and gives a higher level of
confidence that the results presented by NIST are a true measure of the
submitted software.

Contents
--------
 * Interaction Required:
   - **[config/]:** Directory in which all configuration files required by your
     libraries reside. This directory will be read-only at runtime. Use of
     configurations is optional.
   - **[lib/]:** Directory in which all required libraries reside. There must
     be at least library, the **core** library, and that library **must** follow
     the ELFT naming convention.
   - **[../libelft/]:** Code for the shared library implementing methods
     declared in [../include/elft.h].
   - **[../include/elft.h]:** The ELFT [API].
   - **[validate]:** Script that automates running the validation and performing
     checks on the output.
 * Supporting Files
   - **[README.md]:** This file.
   - **[src/]:** Source code to build the validation executable.
   - **[VERSION]** Version number of the validation package.

Requirements
------------

 * Fingerprint Imagery
   - Because organizations must agree to NIST Special Database terms and
     conditions, the required fingerprint imagery is not included in this GitHub
     repository. Request and download the data from our [requests website].
 * Ubuntu Server 20.04.03 LTS
   - Even if this is not the latest version of Ubuntu Server, it will be the
     version used to run the evaluation. Direct downloads are available from the
     [Ubuntu Mirrors] ([ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA], [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Europe]) and directly from the [NIST
     Image Group].
   - We **highly suggest** matching the exact versions of packages installed in
     our environment. A link to the names and versions of these pacakages is
     available.
   - The [validate] script  requires these base Ubuntu Server packages:
      - `base-files`, `binutils`, `cmake`, `coreutils`, `curl`, `dpkg`, `file`,
        `findutils`, `g++`, `gawk`, `grep`, `libc-bin`, `make`, `sed`, `tar`,
        `xz-utils`

It is **highly suggested** that you make sure your submission will build and run
as expected on environments as close as possible to the NIST evaluation
machines, in order to avoid validation delays. Timing statistics are reported
when run on a **Intel Xeon Gold 6140** CPU, but all Intel CPU types shall be
supported. Use of unavailable intrinsics shall degrade gracefully.

Be prepared to explain differences in templates and similarity scores. If at all
possible, please prevent differences due to hardware, lossy math and other
optimizations, and the like. Understand that NIST has a _right to reject_
submissions that cannot explain or correct differences.

How to Run
----------
 1. Put your compiled core library and any other required libraries in [lib/].
 2. Put any required configuration files in [config/].
 3. Put ELFT fingerprint imagery received from NIST in this directory (i.e.,
    the directory containing this file, [README.md]).
 4. Execute [validate] (`./validate`).
 5. **If successful**, sign *and* encrypt the resulting output archive in a
    single step, and e-mail it, along with the encrypting identity's public key,
    to elft@nist.gov. For an example of how to use GnuPG to encrypt, run
    `validate encrypt`. If unsuccessful, correct any errors described and try
    again.

### A Note about Paths
This following  files may contain absolute paths to files on your system. If
this information is sensitive, you may redact the paths, leaving the structure
of the file content the same.

 * canary.log
 * compile.log
 * run-createReferenceDatabase.log
 * run-extract-probe.log
 * run-extract-reference.log
 * run-search.log

Checks Performed
----------------

 * Implementation can handle being `fork`ed.
 * Validation package and imagery is at most recent revision level.
 * Appropriate operating system version installed.
 * Libraries and configurations can be placed randomly on disk.
 * Appropriately-named ELFT core software library is present.
 * Software library links properly against the validation driver.
 * Crashes do not occur when handling various types of imagery, including
   - atypical resolutions;
   - atypical data sources (e.g., features-only, latent probe)
   - unknown metadata;
   - non-contact imagery;
   - blank or gradient patterns.

While the validation package tries to eliminate errors from the ELFT
submission, it is not perfect, and there are still several ways in which the
package might approve you for submission that NIST may later reject.
