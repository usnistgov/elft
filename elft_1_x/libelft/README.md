`libelft`
=========

`libelft` is a shared library containing implementations for methods defined in
[`elft.h`]. *Core* ELFT libraries must link against `libelft`.

NIST will build a clean copy of `libelft` and link it against the main
evaluation executable along with the ELFT core library. This is to ensure that
the implementations of `libelft` are equivalent for all participants, and is
additionally the reason why these methods were not implemented directly in
[`elft.h`].

Building
--------
Use the included `CMakeLists.txt` to build out of source. This will build
`libelft.so`.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Linking
-------
When building a core ELFT library, use these example compiler flags (from
`g++`/`ld`) to properly link against this library.

> `-L/path/containing/libelft -lelft -Wl,-rpath,/path/containing/libelft -Wl,--enable-new-dtags`

Communication
