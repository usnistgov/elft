Evaluation of Latent Friction Ridge Technology
==============================================

Evaluation of Latent Friction Ridge Technology (ELFT) is a series of public
tests of one-to-many automated latent friction ridge searching algorithms. Such
algorithms are usually part of a larger Automated Biometric Identification
System (ABIS). Implementations are provided one or more latent friction ridge
images and/or feature sets, and are expected to produce a list of candidates
from a large reference database.

Studies of latent friction ridge technology have taken place at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 2006.

Tests
-----
There have been several iterations of ELFT over the years. The current version
is simply called _ELFT_. Differentiations of the test will be referred to by
changing the version number of the application programming interface (API).
Participation in the evaluation is ongoing.

Previous tests with unversioned APIs and time-limited participation were
entitled ELFT07 (2006-2007) and [ELFT-EFS] Evaluations #1 (2008-2011) and #2
(2010-2012).

Communication
